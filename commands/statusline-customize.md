# Statusline Customization

Walk the user through configuring their interline statusline interactively. Read existing config, present choices, write updates, and preview.

## Prerequisites

1. Check that `~/.claude/statusline.sh` exists. If not, tell the user to run `/interline:statusline-setup` first.
2. Read `~/.claude/interline.json` (create with `{}` if missing). This is the source of truth for all customization.

## Interactive Flow

Present each section as an `AskUserQuestion` call. Always show the **current value** in the option descriptions so the user knows what they have. Skip sections the user isn't interested in.

### Step 1: Which sections to configure?

Ask which areas they want to customize (multiSelect):
- **Layers** — toggle which status segments are visible (dispatch, bead, phase, interserve, coordination, context, pressure, budget)
- **Colors** — change ANSI 256 colors for each segment
- **Labels** — rename the interserve/dispatch prefix text
- **Format** — separator style, branch separator, title truncation length

### Step 2: Layer toggles (if selected)

For each layer, show its current state (enabled/disabled) and what it does:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `dispatch` | Active Codex dispatch task name and status |
| `bead` | In-progress bead IDs, titles, and priorities |
| `bead_query` | Live `bd list` queries (disable for speed if bd is slow) |
| `phase` | Workflow phase detected from transcript (Brainstorming, Executing, etc.) |
| `interserve` | Rainbow "Interserve" label when clodex-toggle is active |
| `coordination` | Multi-agent coordination status from interlock |
| `context` | Context window usage percentage inside model brackets |
| `pressure` | Context pressure indicator from intercheck |
| `budget` | Budget consumption percentage from interstat |

Use multiSelect to let them pick which layers to **disable** (all default to enabled). Layers not selected remain enabled.

### Step 3: Colors (if selected)

Show a reference of useful ANSI 256 colors:
- Reds: 196 (bright), 160 (dark), 203 (salmon)
- Oranges: 208, 214, 215
- Yellows: 220, 226, 228
- Greens: 34, 46, 82, 157
- Blues: 33, 75, 111, 117
- Purples: 141, 183, 177
- Grays: 240, 244, 245, 250

For each color key, show the current value and let them type a new one. The color keys are:
- `dispatch`, `bead`, `phase`, `branch`, `coordination`
- `context`, `context_warn`, `context_critical`
- `priority` (array of 5: P0-P4)
- `interserve` (array for rainbow, or single number)

### Step 4: Labels (if selected)

Ask for custom text for:
- `labels.interserve` — the rainbow-colored label shown when interserve mode is active (default: "Interserve")
- `labels.dispatch_prefix` — prefix before dispatch task name (default: "Interserve")

### Step 5: Format (if selected)

Ask about:
- `format.separator` — between segments (default: ` | `)
- `format.branch_separator` — between project and branch (default: `:`)
- `format.title_max_chars` — max bead title length before truncation (default: 30)

## Writing Config

After each section, merge changes into `~/.claude/interline.json`. Read the file, parse JSON, update only the changed keys, write back. Never overwrite keys the user didn't change.

Use Python for the merge:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json, sys
path = '$HOME/.claude/interline.json'
try:
    with open(path) as f: cfg = json.load(f)
except: cfg = {}
# merge updates here
with open(path, 'w') as f: json.dump(cfg, f, indent=2); f.write('\n')
"
```

## Preview

After all changes, generate a preview by running the statusline with test input:

```bash
echo '{"model":{"display_name":"Opus 4.6"},"workspace":{"current_dir":"'$(pwd)'"},"session_id":"test-preview","context_window":{"used_percentage":42.5}}' | ~/.claude/statusline.sh
```

Show the output and explain what each segment means. Remind the user they need to restart their session for changes to take full effect in the live statusline.
